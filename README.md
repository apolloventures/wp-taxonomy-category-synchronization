<h1>WP Taxonomy Category Synchronization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
  
<p>This WordPress plugin is designed to synchronize taxonomy categories across different content types within WP Job Manager and the Cariera theme, including resume_category, company_category, and job_listing_category. It handles specific metadata fields like cariera_background_image, cariera_image_icon, and cariera_font_icon to ensure metadata is correctly copied during synchronization.</p>
